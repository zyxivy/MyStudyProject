//There is a room with n lights which are turned on initially and 4 buttons on the wall.After performing exactly m unknown operations towards buttons, you need to return how many different kinds of status of the n lights could be.
//
//Suppose n lights are labeled as number[1, 2, 3 ..., n], function of these 4 buttons are given below :
//
//Flip all the lights.
//Flip lights with even numbers.
//Flip lights with odd numbers.
//Flip lights with(3k + 1) numbers, k = 0, 1, 2, ...
//Example 1:
//Input: n = 1, m = 1.
//	Output : 2
//	Explanation : Status can be : [on], [off]
//	Example 2 :
//	Input : n = 2, m = 1.
//	Output : 3
//	Explanation : Status can be : [on, off], [off, on], [off, off]
//	Example 3 :
//	Input : n = 3, m = 1.
//	Output : 4
//	Explanation : Status can be : [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off], [off, on, on].
//	Note : n and m both fit in range[0, 1000].

//For any operation, only odd or even matters, i.e. 0 or 1. Two same operations equal no operation.
//The first 3 operations can be reduced to 1 or 0 operation.For example, flip all + flip even = flip odd.So the result of the first 3 operations is the same as either 1 operation or original.
//The solution for n > 3 is the same as n = 3.
//For example, 1 0 0 ....., I use 0 and 1 to represent off and on.
//The state of 2nd digit indicates even flip; The state of 3rd digit indicates odd flip; And the state difference of 1st and 3rd digits indicates 3k + 1 flip.

	if (n == 2) return m == 1 ? 3 : 4;
