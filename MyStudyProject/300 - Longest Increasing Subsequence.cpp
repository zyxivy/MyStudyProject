//Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
//For example,
//Given[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18],
//The longest increasing subsequence is[2, 3, 7, 101], therefore the length is 4. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
//Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
//Follow up : Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity ?
