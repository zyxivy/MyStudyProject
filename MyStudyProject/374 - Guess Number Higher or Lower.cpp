//We are playing the Guess Game.The game is as follows :
//
//I pick a number from 1 to n.You have to guess which number I picked.
//
//Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
//
//You call a pre - defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results(-1, 1, or 0) :
//
//    -1 : My number is lower
//    1 : My number is higher
//    0 : Congrats!You got it!
//    Example :
//    n = 10, I pick 6.
//
//    Return 6.
