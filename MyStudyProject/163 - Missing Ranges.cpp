//Given a sorted integer array where the range of elements are[0, 99] inclusive, return its missing ranges.For example, given[0, 1, 3, 50, 75], return[“2”, “4->49”, “51->74”, “76->99”]
//Example Questions Candidate Might Ask :
//Q: What if the given array is empty ?
//    A : Then you should return[“0->99”] as those ranges are missing.
//    Q : What if the given array contains all elements from the ranges ?
//    A : Return an empty list, which means no range is missing.
//    Solution
////    Compare the gap between two neighbor elements and output its range, simple as that right ? 
//This seems deceptively easy, except there are multiple edge cases to consider, 
//such as the first and last element, which does not have previous and next element respectively.
//Also, what happens when the given array is empty ? 
//We should output the range “0->99”.As it turns out, 
//if we could add two “artificial” elements, –1 before the first element and 100 after the last element, 
//we could avoid all the above pesky cases.
