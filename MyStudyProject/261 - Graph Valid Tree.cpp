//Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges(each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.
//Notice
//You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges.Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as[1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
//Example
//Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.
//Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
